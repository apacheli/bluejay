# What's New in Bluejay 0.2.0?

## Install

```
$ bun add https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay
```

## QoL Changes

- Bluejay now uses preloading to make importing smoother for `.md`, `.mdx`, and `.svg` modules.
- Assets and pages can now be defined manually.
- Assets now load to `/` instead of `/assets` relative to `BluejayOptions.path`.
- Bluejay now uses TypeScript which should overall improve the development experience.
- We also added a blog page.

## Optimizations

- Pages load ~**38**% faster on uncached `.md`/`.mdx` files and ~**9.1**x faster if cached. Cached files are stored in `.bluejay` relative to `Bun.cwd`.
- Less logging is done which results in faster code execution.
