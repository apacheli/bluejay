# What's New in Bluejay 0.7.0?

## Install

```
$ bun add https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay
```

## Breaking: Rendering Changes

We've been experimenting with other templating languages such as Svelte since 0.3.0. We're happy to say **support for Svelte has arrived** :tada:. However, you may need to change how your rendering method works as Bluejay is no longer bound to MDX.

Previously you could write this in Bluejay 0.6.0:

```js
import { start } from "bluejay";

await start({
    render: (page, pages) => {
        return <Page><page.mod.default /></Page>;
    },
});
```

In Bluejay 0.7.0, your code must be updated to the following:

```js
import { start } from "bluejay";
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from "preact-render-to-string";

await start({
    render: (page, pages) => {
        return renderToStaticMarkup(<Page><page.mod.default /></Page>);
    },
});
```

This change grants us more flexibility by not having Bluejay bound to a specific templating language. We've also updated the [Bluejay template](https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay-app) to help make the process easier.

## Support for Svelte

As mentioned earlier, Svelte components are now handled by Bluejay.

In your `bunfig.toml`, add the following preloader:

```toml
preload = ["bluejay/svelte"]
```

Install the following packages:

```sh
bun add svelte mdsvex
```

That's it! You can now import `.svelte` files. Bluejay will automatically compile and cache them to `.bluejay/svelte`.

> [!NOTE]
> Bluejay compiles all Svelte components as "server" components.

In your main `render` method, include the following:

```js
import { start, BLUEJAY_DEV } from "bluejay";
import { render } from "svelte/server";

await start({
    render: (page, pages) => {
        const { head, body } = render(page.mod.default);
        return `<html lang="en"><head>${head}</head><body>${body}${BLUEJAY_DEV}</body></html>`;
    },
});
```

If you want to try out the demo, see [the Svelte template for Bluejay](https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay-svelte).

## Browser Open Fix

Bluejay now opens the browser after all your pages have been loaded. Bluejay would previously preload opening the browser which would result in responsiveness issues.

## WebSocket Fix

`BLUEJAY_DEV` is now a string. If you're using JSX, use `BLUEJAY_JSX` instead of `BLUEJAY_DEV` for watching page updates:

```diff
- <BLUEJAY_DEV />
+ <BLUEJAY_JSX />
```
